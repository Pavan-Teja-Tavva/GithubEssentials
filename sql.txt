Normalization is a systematic approach in database design to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing data into multiple related tables. This ensures the database is efficient, consistent, and free from anomalies (like insertion, deletion, or update anomalies). Letâ€™s go step by step:

1NF (First Normal Form)
Definition: A table is in 1NF if:

All column values are atomic (indivisible).

There are no repeating groups or arrays within rows.

Example (Before Normalization - Not in 1NF):

StudentID	Name	Subjects
1	John Smith	Math, Science
2	Jane Doe	English, History
Problem: Multiple subjects are stored in a single column, violating atomicity.

After Applying 1NF:

StudentID	Name	Subject
1	John Smith	Math
1	John Smith	Science
2	Jane Doe	English
2	Jane Doe	History

2NF (Second Normal Form)
Definition: A table is in 2NF if:

It is in 1NF.

All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key (no partial dependency).

Example (Before Normalization - Not in 2NF):

StudentID	CourseID	StudentName	CourseName
1	C101	John Smith	Mathematics
1	C102	John Smith	Physics
2	C101	Jane Doe	Mathematics

Problem: StudentName depends on StudentID, and CourseName depends on CourseID. These are partial dependencies.

After Applying 2NF:
 Student Table:

StudentID	StudentName
1	John Smith
2	Jane Doe

Course Table:

CourseID	CourseName
C101	Mathematics
C102	Physics

Enrollment Table (Bridging Table):

StudentID	CourseID
1	C101
1	C102
2	C101
3NF (Third Normal Form)
Definition: A table is in 3NF if:

It is in 2NF.

It has no transitive dependency (non-prime attributes do not depend on other non-prime attributes).

Example (Before Normalization - Not in 3NF):

StudentID	StudentName	City	ZIPCode
1	John Smith	New York	10001
2	Jane Doe	Boston	02115

Problem: City depends on ZIPCode, not directly on StudentID. This creates a transitive dependency.

After Applying 3NF: 

Student Table:

StudentID	StudentName	ZIPCode
1	John Smith	10001
2	Jane Doe	02115

ZIPCode Table:

ZIPCode	City
10001	New York
02115	Boston
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
Definition: A table is in BCNF if:

It is in 3NF.

For every functional dependency (X â†’ Y), X is a superkey.

Example (Before Normalization - Not in BCNF):

CourseID	Instructor	Classroom
C101	Dr. Smith	Room 101
C102	Dr. Jones	Room 102
C101	Dr. Brown	Room 101
Problem: CourseID and Instructor together determine Classroom, but CourseID alone is not a superkey.

After Applying BCNF: Course Table:

CourseID	Classroom
C101	Room 101
C102	Room 102
Instructor Table:

CourseID	Instructor
C101	Dr. Smith
C101	Dr. Brown
C102	Dr. Jones
Why Use Normalization?
Before Normalization:

Redundant data: The same information appears multiple times.

Data anomalies: Insertion, deletion, or update of data can cause inconsistency.

Harder to maintain and scale.

After Normalization:

Eliminates redundancy by splitting the data into multiple tables.

Ensures data integrity by reducing anomalies.

Makes the database more efficient and flexible for querying.

Normalization is like tidying up a cluttered roomâ€”it may take effort, but it saves you time, space, and frustration in the long run. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific form? ðŸ˜Š

Anomalies can occur in databases when normalization has not been properly applied or when the database is not in higher normalization forms. Here's a breakdown:

Before 1NF:

Insertion anomalies: You might not be able to add a new record if certain attributes are missing.

Deletion anomalies: Deleting a record might result in losing valuable information related to other attributes.

Update anomalies: Updating a piece of information might require modifying it in multiple places, leading to inconsistency.

1NF:

Eliminates repeating groups, making the data atomic. While 1NF resolves some anomalies, partial dependency can still cause insertion and update issues.

2NF:

Resolves anomalies caused by partial dependency. However, if there are transitive dependencies, anomalies like redundancy and inconsistency can persist.

3NF:

Eliminates transitive dependency anomalies, ensuring non-key attributes are directly related to the primary key.

However, cases of functional dependencies not handled by superkeys might still result in anomalies.

BCNF:

Addresses all anomalies caused by functional dependencies. It is considered the ideal form for eliminating anomalies completely.

Anomalies are most likely to occur when the database is below 3NF or BCNF, as lower forms are prone to redundancy and inconsistency.
